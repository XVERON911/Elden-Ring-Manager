**Elden Ring Manager (ERM)**
- ***ERM*** Aims to fix Seamless Coop Mod for older game Versions ex: v1.12  
- ***ERM*** will **NEVER** manipulate the game's Save Files !
- ***ERM*** uses `Memory-Reading & Writing` to Write the Game's data
- **ERM** Works with Cracked/Pirated versions of the game
![(Elden Ring Manager)](Screenshot.png)
```yaml
-ERM need Elden Ring & Steam paths in your drive (First use only):
Example:
D:\Games\ELDEN RING - Shadow Of The Erdtree
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam

-ERM need you to set up the Session password & whether to allow invaders or not (First use only):

-Launch Seamless Coop will Attempt to launch the Game with Seamless Coop and bypass it's known Error:

-Checker State -> Periodically checking for the Game & Steam if running or not:

-Read Button will read the game's Memory so it can fetch Player Stats, Health and more..:

-Freeze HP/FP will run a script that will keep them on the last number you set in ERM::

-Set Runes has a maximum amount of Runes you can give as the Game will crash if you gave more:

-Rune Arc Status will activate the Rune you have (instead of the ingame Rune Arc):

```
```diff
-DO NOT PRESS READ BUTTON WHILE IN MAIN MENU OR LOADING SCREEN
-DO NOT CHANGE HP/FP VALUES WHILE FREEZE IS ON (ERM IS WRITING THE SAME DATA YOU ARE CHANGING)
-MAKE SURE OF THE STEAM PATH BEFORE LAUNCHING SEAMLESS COOP THROUGH ERM (FIRST TIME ONLY)
-LAUNCH SEAMLESS COOP BUTTON IS INTENDED FOR OLDER GAME VERSIONS
-DO NOT USE LAUNCH SEAMLESS COOP WITH A WORKING SEAMLESS COOP (NEWER) GAME VERSION
